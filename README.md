# House Prices Advanced Regression

## Overview

We tackled the Kaggle challenge 'House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques'  (can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)
It consists of predicting with Machine Learning the prices of suburbans houses in the US.


##Dataset

Dataset is given by the Kaggle competition. It contains 43 categorical and 36 numerical variables describing the characteristics of residential homes in Ames, Iowa (USA).


## Main Steps

- Dataset exploration
- Selection of features (for numerical and categorical variables)
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Trainning + testing the model
- Improving Predictions 
- Final testing



##Techniques and tools

Data visualization : correlation matrix, histograms, scatterplots,bars - [Matplotlib, Seaborn]
Features tweeking :masked variables, one hot encoding, grouping,...
Standardization : StandardScaler 
PCA (principal component analysis)
Pycaret
Random Forest regressor 
Hyperparameter tuning : gridsearch
